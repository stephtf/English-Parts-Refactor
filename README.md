# Static Markup Coding Exercise

## Description
It’s time to show off your skills and determination. You are being asked to refactor this statically generated site into a project using the tech stack requested in the invite (i.e. VueJs, LESS, etc.). There will also be additional tech requests in the invite so please pay close attention and implement the features requested.

## Files
* EnglishParts.html => entry point
* /files => supporting media and stylesheet

## Setup
If you open the EnglishParts.html file locally in a browser you’ll see a pure-HTML mockup of the home page of the site.

## Notes
* This task should not consume more than 4 hours of your time
* Once you are done please push your working repository up to your personal GitHub account and send us a link for review

## Parting Thoughts
We realize that you may not know all of the requirements being asked so this is your opportunity to get familiar with a new technology.  We’re not looking for one particular solution or even a correct/complete solution although that would be great. We want to see how you get up to speed on new languages and how quickly you can catch on.

If you need more information please let us know else if we don’t hear anything else back we’ll assume this is pretty straightforward and that you’re moving ahead.
